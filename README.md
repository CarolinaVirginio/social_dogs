# Social Dogs — Social Network for Pets

This project is a simple social network for dog lovers, built with **React** and **Vite**.  
At the moment, I’m working on the basic structure of the application while following a React course and adapting the project as I learn.

## Tech Stack

- React 18
- Vite
- React Router DOM

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/CarolinaVirginio/social_dogs.git
cd social_dogs
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

4. Open in the browser:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

## Project Status

This project is currently in the early development stage while I build the layout, components, and routes.

More features will be added as I progress through the course.

## Features (in development)

- Initial React structure
- React Router setup
- Home and Login pages
- Fixed Header and Footer
- User registration and login system
- Photo upload
- User profile
- Posts feed
- Comment and like system
- Responsive theme

## Project Goals

This project aims to:

- Strengthen my foundation in modern React
- Practice componentization, routing, hooks, and styling
- Build a complete project for my portfolio
- Implement improvements beyond the original course content

## Study Basis

The development is inspired by the course material, but includes several personal adaptations:

- Reorganized project structure
- Additional components
- Modernized styling and architecture
- Necessary adjustments for React 18 + Vite
